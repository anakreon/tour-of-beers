# Tour of Beers

## Goals:
- Use built-in Angular directives to show and hide elements and display lists of beers.
- Create Angular components to display beer details and show an array of beers.
- Use one-way data binding for read-only data.
- Add editable fields to update a model with two-way data binding.
- Bind component methods to user events, like keystrokes and clicks.
- Enable users to select a beer from a master list and edit that beer in the details view.
- Format beer data with pipes
- Create a shared service to assemble the beers.
- Use routing to navigate among different views and their components.
